- Keep: Used stored procedures to bundle multiple frequently used SQL statements together and execute them collectively like a function
- Problem: Triggers are pre-configured to automatically execute additional query tasks when an update, insert, or delete operation occurs on a table
- Try: The difference between a stored procedure and a trigger is that, a stored procedure is executed only when explicitly called, while a trigger is executed automatically every time a DML operation is performed
