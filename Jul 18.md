- Keep: Studied Pandas, a panel data system that allows you to track multiple entities over time to obtain data
- Problem: Experienced that NumPy operations can be used directly when working with the DataFrame data type
- Try: Remembering that NumPy has row vectors as the default, while Pandas has column vectors as the default
