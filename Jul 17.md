- Keep: Studied Numpy(Numerical Python), a linear algebra library that performs numerical operations on
        vectors, matrices, and other data structures, as well as Pandas, a panel data system that
        allows you to track multiple entities over time to obtain data
- Problem: Thinking about the implementation of ndarray
- Try: Get to know functions like np.nan that can help you do data preprocessing well
