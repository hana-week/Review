- Keep: Learned about importing and using packages and modules, different types of errors, various methods of exception handling, and classes in Python.
- Problem: Didn't know where the errors are occurring becuase haven't tried executing the course content.
- Try:
      1. Using module aliases to avoid conflicts with built-in functions.
      2. Remembering to handle exceptions from the most specific to the most general.
